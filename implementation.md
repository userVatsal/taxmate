# TaxMate Backend Implementation Plan

This document describes how to implement the tasks and actions outlined in `masterplan.md` for the TaxMate backend.

---

## 1. Project Phases

### Phase 1: Core Data Ingestion & Categorization
- Implement CSV/JSON upload and parsing (Pandas)
- Build API endpoints for transaction ingestion (FastAPI)
- Normalize and validate transaction data
- Implement basic rule-based categorization

### Phase 2: AI/ML Integration
- Integrate OpenAI GPT or train a custom classifier for advanced categorization
- Add logic to flag business-related and tax-deductible transactions
- Detect recurring transactions

### Phase 3: Document Generation
- Generate Profit & Loss statements (Pandas DataFrame to PDF/CSV)
- Generate expense and invoice summaries

### Phase 4: Tax Analysis & Automation
- Implement AI-powered tax liability estimation
- Suggest deduction opportunities based on HMRC rules
- Auto-fill Self Assessment tax return forms
- Add VAT handling logic

### Phase 5: Security & Compliance
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Implement user data export and deletion
- Add audit logging for data access
- Ensure GDPR compliance

### Phase 6: API & UI Integration
- Build REST API endpoints for all features
- Document API (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Integrate with frontend (Vercel)
