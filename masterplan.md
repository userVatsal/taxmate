# TaxMate Backend Masterplan

## Overview

Build a backend module for TaxMate, a business tool for UK companies and sole traders, that:

- Ingests card transaction data (CSV, API, or JSON)
- Analyzes and categorizes transactions
- Flags tax-deductible items
- Generates accounting documents (P&L, expense summaries, invoice summaries)
- Uses AI to analyze tax liabilities and deduction opportunities (HMRC-compliant)
- Prepares Self Assessment tax return forms with deductions
- Handles recurring transactions and VAT
- Ensures UK GDPR compliance and data security

---

## 1. Data Ingestion

- **Supported formats:** CSV, JSON, direct API (e.g., Open Banking, Plaid, or custom)
- **Features:**
  - Upload and parse CSV/JSON files
  - API endpoint for direct transaction ingestion
  - Data validation and normalization

---

## 2. Transaction Analysis

- **Categorization:**
  - Use rules and AI/ML (e.g., GPT, fine-tuned classifier) to assign categories (travel, office, meals, etc.)
  - Identify business-related vs. personal expenses
  - Detect recurring transactions (subscriptions, rent, etc.)
- **Tax Deductibility:**
  - Flag items likely to be tax-deductible under HMRC rules
  - Highlight VAT-eligible transactions

## 3. Document Generation

- **Profit & Loss Statement:**
  - Summarize income and expenses by category and period
- **Expense Summary:**
  - List and total expenses by category
- **Invoice Summary (optional):**

## 4. AI-Powered Tax Analysis

- **Tax Liability Estimation:**
  - Use AI to estimate tax owed based on categorized transactions and HMRC rules
- **Deduction Opportunities:**

- **Self Assessment Preparation:**
  - Auto-fill Self Assessment tax return forms with calculated figures and deductions

---

## 5. Compliance & Security

- **UK GDPR:**
  - Encrypt all personal and financial data at rest and in transit

  - Identify VAT on expenses and income
  - Prepare VAT summaries for returns

---

## 7. Technology Stack

- **AI/ML:** OpenAI GPT (API), or custom fine-tuned classifier (e.g., scikit-learn, HuggingFace)
- **Web Framework:** FastAPI or Flask (for API endpoints)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (preferred), or SQLite for prototyping
- **Security:** PyJWT, HTTPS, encryption libraries
